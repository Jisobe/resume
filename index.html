                <p id = "about">I am a 6 year Navy veteran with extensive experience in leadership, adaptability, learning, and initiative. I have led a team of 20 in maintaining the equipment that ensured the health and safety of over 4,000 sailors as well as readiness and deployability of the ship. I have been able to use my initiative to create and implement workflows and budgets that have increased productivity by 30% and taken my company from a net loss to a net gain in just a year's time. My experience as both a leader and team member has equipped me with the understanding of how large complex organizations function as well as the importance and necessity of timeliness. I am eager to adapt these skills to create products and increase company value.</p>
